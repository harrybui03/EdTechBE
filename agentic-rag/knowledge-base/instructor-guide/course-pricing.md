# Setting Course Pricing

## Overview

This guide covers how to set pricing for your course, including free and paid options, currency selection, and pricing strategies.

## Accessing Pricing Settings

1. Navigate to your course editing page
2. Click on "Pricing" in the navigation menu
3. You'll see the pricing configuration interface

## Pricing Options

### Free Courses

To create a free course:

1. Set "Paid Course" toggle to OFF (unchecked)
2. Set both Original Price and Selling Price to 0
3. Save your changes

**When to Offer Free Courses:**

- Build your teaching reputation
- Attract students to your paid courses
- Provide value to the community
- Test course content before charging

### Paid Courses

To create a paid course:

1. Set "Paid Course" toggle to ON (checked)
2. Enter pricing information (see below)
3. Save your changes

## Setting Prices

### Original Price

- **Definition**: The regular/list price of your course
- **Purpose**: Shows the standard price before discounts
- **Example**: If your course normally costs $100, enter 100

### Selling Price

- **Definition**: The actual price students pay
- **Purpose**: Can be lower than original price for promotions
- **Example**: If offering a $20 discount, set selling price to $80

### Price Display Logic

- If Selling Price < Original Price: Shows discount (e.g., "$80 $100")
- If Selling Price = Original Price: Shows single price (e.g., "$100")
- If both are 0: Course appears as "Free"

## Currency Selection

Select the currency for your course pricing:

- **VND**: Vietnamese Dong
- **USD**: US Dollar
- **EUR**: Euro
- **GBP**: British Pound

**Important Notes:**

- Choose currency based on your target audience
- Currency cannot be changed after students enroll
- Consider exchange rates if targeting international students

## Pricing Strategy Tips

### Research Market Rates

- Check similar courses on the platform
- Research competitor pricing
- Consider your expertise level
- Factor in course length and content quality

### Value-Based Pricing

- Price based on the value students receive
- Consider career impact and skill development
- Factor in your teaching experience and credentials
- Higher quality content can command higher prices

### Pricing Tiers

Consider offering:

- **Free Course**: Build audience and reputation
- **Low-Price Course** ($10-50): Entry-level content, attract students
- **Mid-Price Course** ($50-200): Comprehensive courses, main revenue
- **Premium Course** ($200+): Advanced, specialized, or certification courses

### Promotional Pricing

- Use Selling Price lower than Original Price to show discounts
- Create urgency with limited-time offers
- Consider seasonal promotions
- Test different price points to find optimal pricing
