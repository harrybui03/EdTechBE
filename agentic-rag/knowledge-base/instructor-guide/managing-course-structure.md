# Managing Course Structure

## Overview

After creating a course, you need to build its structure by adding chapters and lessons. This guide covers how to organize your course content effectively.

## Accessing Course Structure

1. Navigate to your course editing page (`/instructor/courses/{courseId}/edit`)
2. Click on "Course structure" in the navigation menu
3. You'll see the curriculum management interface

## Adding Chapters

### Creating a New Chapter

1. Click the "Add Chapter" or "+" button
2. Enter the chapter title (required)
3. Optionally add a chapter summary describing what students will learn
4. Click "Create" to save the chapter

### Chapter Best Practices

- **Clear Learning Goals**: Each chapter should have a specific learning objective
- **Logical Flow**: Organize chapters in a sequence that builds knowledge progressively
- **Descriptive Titles**: Use titles that clearly indicate what students will learn
- **Chapter Summaries**: Help students understand the value of each section

## Adding Lessons

### Lesson Types

You can create three types of lessons:

1. **Video Lessons**: Upload video content or provide video URLs
2. **Article Lessons**: Write text-based content with markdown support
3. **Quiz Lessons**: Create assessments to test student understanding

### Creating a Lesson

1. Select a chapter where you want to add the lesson
2. Click "Add Lesson" or the "+" button within the chapter
3. Choose the lesson type (Video, Article, or Quiz)
4. Fill in the lesson details:
   - **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
   - **Content**: Video URL, article content, or quiz questions
   - **Position**: Order within the chapter
5. Save the lesson

### Lesson Best Practices

- **Ideal Length**: Keep video lessons between 2-7 minutes for better engagement
- **Single Concept**: Focus on one topic per lesson
- **Mix Types**: Alternate between video, article, and quiz lessons
- **Clear Titles**: Make it easy for students to find and review specific topics
